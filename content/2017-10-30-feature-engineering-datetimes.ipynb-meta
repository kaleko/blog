Summary: Many novices (myself included) are treating cyclical variables in their models incorrectly. Inspired by a tweet, I demonstrate how to transform cyclical variables (like hour of the day, month of the year) in the proper way. I show the predictive power of a simple neural network model on a public dataset improving after properly engineering these features.
