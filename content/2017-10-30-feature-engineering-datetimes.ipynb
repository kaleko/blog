    "I was browsing twitter yesterday ([follow me!](https://twitter.com/davidkaleko)) when I came across [this tweet](https://twitter.com/BecomingDataSci/status/924814225637367808) by [Data Science Renee](https://twitter.com/BecomingDataSci) linking to [this Medium article](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/top-6-errors-novice-machine-learning-engineers-make-e82273d394db) called \"Top 6 Errors Novice Machine Learning Engineers Make\" by [Christopher Dossman](https://medium.com/@cdossman). This drew my attention because I'm somewhat new to the field (and even if I weren't, it's always worth reviewing [the fundamentals](http://blog.davidkaleko.com/fundamentals-regression-classification.html)). While I'm not guilty of all six novice mistakes, I'm certainly not innocent either. The most interesting mistake to me was:\n",
    "## \"Not properly dealing with cyclical features\"\n",
    "Christopher writes:\n",
    "> Hours of the day, days of the week, months in a year, and wind direction are all examples of features that are cyclical. Many new machine learning engineers donâ€™t think to convert these features into a representation that can preserve information such as hour 23 and hour 0 being close to each other and not far.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yup. I've tried to predict my fair share of quantities using cyclical features incorrectly. Christopher points out that proper handling of such features involves representing the cyclical features as (x,y) coordinates on a circle. In this blog post, I'll explore this feature engineering task and see if it really improves the predictive capability of a simple model.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, let's download a public dataset that has some cyclical qualities. I found a bi_cycle_ sharing dataset online (pardon the double entendre) which includes some basic features, with the aim of predicting how many bikes are being used at any given hour. Let's download, unzip, and have a quick look."

Zero (midnight) is on the right, and the house increase counterclockwise around the circle. In this way, 23:59 is very close to 00:00, as it should be.\n",

The loss function I'll use is (negative) [mean squared error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error). I'll also use a standard scaler in an sklearn Pipeline, though it probably isn't necessary given the range in values of our two features."
